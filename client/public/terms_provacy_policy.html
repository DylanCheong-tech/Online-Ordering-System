        <h3 class="heading">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform users of our web application of how we collect, use, and
            protect
            their personal information.
            <br />
            This privacy policy applies to all users of our web application who provide us with personal information.
            <br />
            Personal information refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual, including but not
            limited to their name, email address, contact number, and address.
            <br />
            By using the services, you agree to the collection and the usage of the personal information you provided in
            accordance with this privacy policy.

        </p>

        <h3 class="heading">Information Collected</h3>
        <p>
            We collect the following types of personal information from users:
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>

                <li>Contact number</li>
                <li>Addresses</li>
                <li>Any other incidental business purposes related to or in connection with the above</li>
            </ul>

            We collect personal information through online forms and order submissions.
            <br />
            The personal information we collected will be used to facilitate enquiries and orders from our users.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading">Use of Information</h3>
        <p>
            We will use the personal information provided by users to respond to enquiries and fulfill orders.
            <br />
            Only authorized personnel who require access to the personal information for the purpose of responding to
            enquiries and fulfilling orders will have access to the information.
